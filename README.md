# WeatherApp

Demo: http://seeforecast.herokuapp.com/ (it doesn't have all the functionality we want to achiev)

We will create a WeatherApp based the interview task that Backbase gives for new candidates.


We will make a couple of changes to it:
First - we will have the user input the city,

Second - when you first load the app it will auto locate the user and show the weather for that location,

Third - if the user inputs a city that doesnt exist we should provide him with a meaningfull error,

Fourth - we will show the current time in the selected location


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
